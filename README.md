# AUXION

Auxion makes it easy for sellers to list properties and buyers to submit offers in what is commonly known as FSBO(For sale by Owner) practice in the real estate area.
In an auction-like manner, sellers can see tabulated realtime updates of bids information that have been placed for their properties and sort them by their priorities. Buyers can place bids on properties and can see realtime the highest bid price and put in new bids.
